CHANGELOG for English calc (changes since v1.0.0):

v1.0.1 - 
Added fringe and outer London weighting options.
bug fixes

v1.0.2 -
Added Scottish tax toggle (should've been a 1.x.0 update, but I didn't think about)

v1.0.3 -
bug fixes

v1.1.0 - 
main change:
adds the option to use the calc if you don't know your gross pay, but do know your hours (calculates NROC allowances, weekend allowances and night enhancements (taking account of LTFT)).

other:
rather than using random code whose origin I cannot recall, I re-wrote it the samwe way I calculated rest-of-UK taxes. It know means if there are changes to tax codes (i.e. extra tax bands), I can handle it more easily.

added version number into the title
provides a link to explain in situations where pensionable pay is greater than gross pay
catches null inputs in the gross income and ltft options - and throws an error message

Produces an error message if you select LTFT but input hours such that your basic hours [total hours - enhanced hours] is significantly off from [LTFT Percentage *40] - but still lets you proceed
Produces an error message if entered gross income is impossibly low given other options selected (e.g. LTFT allowance, pay premia, London weighting) - should not let the user proceed
