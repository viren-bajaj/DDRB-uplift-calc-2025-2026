CHANGELOG for English calc (changes since v1.0.0):

v1.0.1 - 
Added fringe and outer London weighting options.
bug fixes

v1.0.2 -
Added Scottish tax toggle (should've been a 1.x.0 update, but I didn't think about)

v1.0.3 -
added a stacked bar chart to help visulaise what's changed
bug fixes

v1.1.0 - 
Main change:
adds the option to use the calc if you don't know your gross pay, but do know your hours (calculates NROC allowances, weekend allowances and night enhancements (taking account of LTFT)).

Other:
rather than using random code whose origin I cannot recall, I re-wrote it the samwe way I calculated rest-of-UK taxes. It know means if there are changes to tax codes (i.e. extra tax bands), I can handle it more easily.

added version number into the title
provides a link to explain in situations where pensionable pay is greater than gross pay
catches null inputs in the gross income and ltft options - and throws an error message

Produces an error message if you select LTFT but input hours such that your basic hours [total hours - enhanced hours] is significantly off from [LTFT Percentage *40] - but still lets you proceed
Produces an error message if entered gross income is impossibly low given other options selected (e.g. LTFT allowance, pay premia, London weighting) - should not let the user proceed


v1.1.1 - 
cleaned up flexible pay premia data and selection
added more warnings to explain weird results (e.g. if you say you're full time, but use 32 basic hours and 8 enhanced hours. The sum of the enhanced hours, weekend allowance and  NROC allowance.  I think I have a better way to handle this but I need to check how pay is presented on pay slips (are 40  hours of which 8 are enhanced listed as 40 hrs +8hrs*0.37, or 32hrs + 8hrs*1.37))
fixed a bug where (assuming you are ltft) if you were doing more frequent weekends a fulltime person, it would apply a multiplier to the fulltime weekend allowance - now if you do more frequent weeknds it doesn't pro-rata, it just uses the correct percentage.

added some info to the ltft box
added more null catching

added a breakdown of what OOH pay is if you do not know your gross
cleaned up some warnings
changed the gross pay calculation (if gross not known) logic - no change in results, but it feels like the logic is more correct

v1.1.2 - 
changed the way OOH pay is presented if gross is not known - this was done to avoid confusion
Essentialy pay in the gross not known scenario is presented as:
  pay for X+Y hours is £W
  of which Y hours attract a 37% enhancement of £Z
This avoids weird confusion if someoen inputs LTFT data in a way that i haven't thought about, and reduces the need for me to handle edge cases

v1.1.3 -
fixed an error with how weekend allowance and NROC allownce were being handled - I had a fraction upside down, so LTFT was inverting its multiplier (should've been less than 1, but error made it greater)

v1.1.4 - 
made changes in preparation for adding other country options (moved some stuff round and added a welsh pay data frame(this could be a non-english-pay data frame since all 3 other nations use some variant of the 2002 contract)) + corrected some spelling errors + added comments to explain what further changes need to be made in case I forget what I was doing or someone else wants to finish this project
  

# to do for 1.2.0 - if notEngland, need to override all the england pay inputs.
		# need to pull in the 24/25 and 25/26 pay scale tables for Wales, Scotland and NI.
		# need to figure out how to take the selected grade and increment from the tables, and how to reference the LTFT tables if required
		# need to check if pay premia exist outside of England (will leave the option for adding them on if they don't in case they exist in the future)
		# need to check if Welsh pay has the same LTFT and pension interaction as English pay. Does banded pay attract pension? + How does the fact FY1s have default 5% banding in Wales effect pension (is it based on the base 100% pay instead of the FY1's 105%?)?
		# need to implement scottish/NI pension decutions/accrual

v1.1.5 - 
updated band selection so it only shows relevant banding, removed an extraneous observe, added welsh pay data frame, added dummy data frames for Scotland/NI,
wales only shows relevant increments - need to do so for scotland/NI

updated todo list
		# calculated what LTFT and banding was (the published percentages but rounded up to the nearest integer. LTFT banding involves rounding for the LTFT pay and then rounding again for the banding)
		# checked GP trainees get 45% banding whilst in GP placements, need to see how it interacts with LTFT
		# Welsh pension deductions/contributions are based on the unbanded pay (this also means the 100% pay for F1 rather than 105% pay that unbanded F1s get). Pension deduction and contribution formulas are otherwise unchanged for wales
		# need to implement scottish/NI pension decutions/accrual

notes and rants as of v1.1.5 -
 		#in NI and Scotland GP registrars get a 45% allowance (additional banding) - need to see if GP does this in Wales. Need to check how it ineracts with ltft. can't find the official documets from HEIW etc that include this 45% in Wales, but it's mentioned in this BMA document https://www.bma.org.uk/media/32qaaeer/junior-doctors-contract-in-wales-pay-journey.pdf
			#why on earth are the scottish and welsh pay scales using increments going from 0 to n, whilst NI uses 1 to (n+1)? Why?
			#why does scotland have differetn SPR and STR scales that differ only at increments 0 and 1, but are the same for increments 2-9? Is this just to frustrate someone who wants to work with the data? becuase it feels like it
			#due to this i need a different data frame for each of Wales/Scotland/NI
			# It turns out NI GPStR has a different base pay to NI SpR/StR
			
			#The LTFT system outside England puts people on scales F5-f9 which act as 50%-90% mults to unbanded pay - unclear how this interacts with GP 45% allowance in NI/Scot/wales
			
			#for scotland I'm going to pretend the pre-2005 arrangments for ltft don't exist, because they don't make snese in the pay circular. 
			#why is it that the English contract TCS document is the only one that's actually legible with regards to pay?
			#I give up with scotland - they have two tables for GP trainees - table 5a and 5b (https://www.publications.scot.nhs.uk/files/pcs2024-dd-01.pdf), but these tables contain payscales for GPStRs and GPspRs (and GPSHOs which as far as I'm aware no longer exist) and table 5a doesn't correspond to any other pay scales that seem to exist
			
				#the data for dental core trainees/DSHOs shouldn't be hard to handle, so I can include it (but i'll leave it for a v1.3.0 if requested). Curiously Scotland and Wales uses 0-6 for DCT/DHSO, but NI uses 1-6

v1.1.6 - 
wales implemented
warning for Scot/NI that prevents user from proceding as these are not implemented yet
spelling

assumed GP trainees can get F5-9 banding and assumed it as applied before GP 45% banding


v1.1.7 - 
commented out unnecesary constants, corrected a variable error, made wales work if you clicked calculate straight away (previously it was returning a salary of zero, but if you changed and unchanged any options it would return the corect salary)
