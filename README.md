This will become a group of aclaculators designed to calculate changes in pay for Resident doctors and Consultants across the UK.

As of yet, the only calculator that has been finished is the English resident doctors calculator.

To do:
1) add welsh, scottish and norther irish pay + banding as alternative pay structures. 
2) Add the option to use scottish income taxes for english pay, 
3) Add rest-of-UK tax for scottish pay (income tax is determined by where you live, not where you work).

4) Make consultant calculators - will be easier once scottish tax toggle has been designed.

Further ideas:
Make a pension projection tool for doctors. If done, I can't imagine designing anything that accounts for switching schemes.
Make a student loan repayment calculator that is more sepcific for doctors (likley eaiser than other public facing calculators due to the semi-predicatble nature of our pay) - examples of other public calculators - https://www.studentloanrepaymentcalc.co.uk/, https://www.student-loan-calculator.co.uk/

Unlikely ideas:
extending any of the above to AFC contracts is unlikely, but not infeasible
