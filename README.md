This will become a group of calculators designed to calculate changes in net and gross pay for Resident doctors and Consultants across the UK. It is intended for these calculators to take pensions, student loans and pay premia into account.

As of yet, the only calculator that has been mostly finished is the English resident doctors calculator.

Resident Doctors calculator - https://virenb.shinyapps.io/English_Resident_Drs_payuplift_calc_25-26/

To do:

~~1) Add the outer london and fringe options to london weighting~~
1) account for locum pay without accidentally uplifting it - this is harder than it sounds because how do you account for a user who includes it in their gross vs separately 
~~2) add options for users who don't know their gross pay, but do know thier hours~~
2) Add welsh, scottish and northern irish pay + banding as alternative pay structures. 
~~3) Add the option to use scottish income taxes for english pay,~~
3) Add rest-of-UK tax for scottish pay (income tax is determined by where you live, not where you work).

4) Make consultant calculators.

Further ideas:
Make a pension projection tool for doctors. If done, I can't imagine designing anything that accounts for switching schemes.
Make a student loan repayment calculator that is more sepcific for doctors (likley easier than other public facing calculators due to the semi-predicatble nature of our pay) - examples of other public calculators - https://www.studentloanrepaymentcalc.co.uk/, https://www.student-loan-calculator.co.uk/

Unlikely ideas:
extending any of the above to AFC contracts is unlikely, but not infeasible
